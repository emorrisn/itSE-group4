| FAIL (insufficient)                                    | Some attempt has been made to tackle the task. The work has little or no merit. Work produced is not fit for purpose. There may be evidence of some basic understanding of relevant concepts and techniques, but this does not meet the level that was taught in class. | Work of limited quality, demonstrating some relevant knowledge and understanding. Users are mostly realistic. Acceptance tests may cover only “happy days scenarios”. Use case diagrams outline some of the actors. Relationships between actors may be identified (where applicable). Relationships between use cases may be outlined by means of either “Include” or “Extend”. System boundary may be shown. Peer assessment form shows at least 40% contribution to team effort. | Competent work, demonstrating reasonable knowledge and understanding, analysis, and accuracy. The work as presented has some minor errors but is limited in scope. Users are realistic. Acceptance tests may cover either “happy days scenarios” or negative situations.
